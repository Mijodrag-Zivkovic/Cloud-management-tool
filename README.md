# Cloud-management-tool
Cloud management tool written with Spring Boot (Backend) and Angular.js (Frontend)

App is divided into 2 parts:
 - management of users
 - management of virtual machines 

For every action, user must have a permission. For user actions, permissions are for basic CRUD operations. </br>
When it comes to VM actions, permissions are for basic CRUD operations, along with START, STOP, RESTART. </br>
Also, users can schedule VM operations at certain time and date.
I didn't have enough time to finish frntend, so some of the features are missing, and there are probably some bugs.
